> This plugin is a refactored and updated verion of an ammazing plugin https://github.com/zsong/diffy which is seems depricated long ago.

> **Note**
> None of the team stand behind Kaleidoscope app have paid me any amount for being a part of this plugin behind the scene. Though they were so kind to provide me a code snippet that let me integrate with their tool in a smooth way.
