# Major update

Hello everyone, due to years of inactivity, the **Diffy** package has been replaced.

The new replacement is **Diffable**. It maintains all the features of its predecessor, while also modernizing those features behind the scenes and even introducing a few new ones.

## Feature list

Let's examine the major changes a bit more closely:

1. The command has changed. Previously, it was `diffy` and now it is `diffable`.
2. The arguments have also changed. The actions available now include: `inline`, `clear`, `kaleidoscope`. You can check their usage in the `Default.sublime-keymap` file (i.e. the plugin keymap settings).
3. The keymap itself hasn't changed, but it's disabled by default due to potential conflicts with default ST key-binding. Thus, you have to manually enable it through the plugin key-bindings menu.
4. The diff engine has been replaced with the default ST3-4 built-in engine. It's much more reliable and robust now.
5. Tabs can now be compared, just like groups. This was one of the two main reasons for initiating this project (the second reason was to leverage the ST diffable engine rather than relying on a custom python script).
6. External diffing tool support has been added. As of now, it only supports the Kaleidoscope app (macOS only). However, there's certainly room to expand the list of supported tools in the future.

Please take a look at the plugin settings to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the complete list of features that this plugin provides.

## Future plans

This package isn't meant to evolve beyond its original functionality. I see it as a tool that just works. Therefore, there are only two conceivable ways it could be enhanced:

1. It could expand the list of supported third-party diff tools.
2. It could introduce new features to the built-in ST diffing tool.

The former seems much more likely to occur in the foreseeable future than the latter.
